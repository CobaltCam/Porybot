Sleep,Volatile,"Sleeping Trainers and Pokémon receive no
bonuses from Evasion, and cannot take actions except
for Free and Swift Actions that would cure Sleep (ex:
activating the Shed Skin Ability). At the end of the
sleeper’s turns, they may make a DC 16 Save Check to
wake up. Whenever a Sleeping Pokémon takes Damage
or loses life from an Attack, they wake up. This does
not include loss of life from passive sources such as
Poison or Burns, but active attacks and effects that cause
Hit Point loss (such as being hit by the Press Feature,
or Super Fang) would wake up their target. Sleeping
targets cannot make Save Checks to be cured of Rage,
Infatuation, or Confusion, but they also cannot hurt
themselves in Confusion. Pokémon and Trainers may
wake an adjacent ally as a Standard Action."
Suppressed,Volatile,"While Suppressed, Pokémon and Trainers
cannot benefit from PP Ups, and have the frequency of
their Moves lowered; At-Will Moves become EOT, and
EOT and Scene x2 Moves become Scene"
Temporary Hit Points,Volatile,"Some effects grant Temporary
Hit Points. Temporary Hit Points are not “healed” away
by effects that cure Status Conditions, but it is lost if the
user is recalled in a Poké Ball, and disappears on its own
after 5 minutes while outside of combat.
Temporary Hit Points are “bonus” health that stacks on
top of “real” Hit Points - so you can benefit from gaining
it even if you are already at full health.
However, Temporary Hit Points are always lost first
from damage or any other effects. Damage carries over
directly to real Hit Points once the Temporary Hit
Points are lost. Furthermore, Temporary Hit Points do
not stack with other Temporary Hit Points – only the
highest value applies.
For example, if you have 10 Temporary Hit Points, and
then gain 8 Temporary Hit Points - nothing happens. If
the next turn you were then to gain 15 Temporary Hit
Points, your Temporary Hit Points would go up to 15
since that is the highest value.
Temporary Hit Points also do not stack with “Real” Hit
Points for the purposes of determining percentages of
Hit Points. If a Pokémon has exactly 1 real Hit Point and
has 50 Temporary Hit Points, they would use the Moves
and effects as if they have 1 Hit Point, not 51."
Fainted,Other,"A Pokémon or Trainer that is at 0 Hit Points or
lower is Fainted, or Knocked Out. A Fainted Pokémon
or Trainer is unconscious due to injuries or other effects,
and cannot use any Actions, Abilities, or Features unless
the Feature or Ability specifically says otherwise.
The “Fainted” Condition is removed only by specific
items such as Revive, or by being brought up to a
positive Hit Point count by healing Features or Moves
such as Wish or Heal Pulse. Potions and other healing
items may still bring a Pokémon above 0 Hit Points,
but it remains Fainted for another 10 minutes. When
a Pokémon becomes Fainted, they are automatically
cured of all Persistent and Volatile Status Conditions."
Blindness,Other,"Blindness represents the target’s vision
becoming obscured. A Blinded Pokémon or Trainer
receives a -6 penalty to Accuracy Rolls, and must make
an Acrobatics Check with a DC of 10 when traveling over
Rough or Slow Terrain or become Tripped. Blindness
is caused by several effects. This is in perpetual effect
in deep darkness, unless the target has Blindsense or
Darkvision. Pokémon or Trainers with Blindsense
cannot be Blinded.
Total"
Total Blindness,Other,"Total Blindness is more than just
obscured vision; it’s total and complete sightlessness,
such as experienced in a completely dark cave or
building interior. Total Blindness has the same
disadvantages as Blindness, and more. Totally Blinded
Pokémon or Trainers have no awareness of the map,
and must declare any shifts as distance relative to them.
Totally Blinded targets receive a -10 total Penalty to
Accuracy Rolls, and cannot use Moves with Priority or
as Interrupts. When making a Shift action, they must
declare if they are moving Slowly or Quickly; moving
Slowly restricts Movement as if Slowed. Moving Quickly
has no Movement Penalty, but if the user attempts to
Shift into Blocking Terrain, Rough Terrain, or Slow
Terrain, they become Tripped. Pokémon or Trainers
with Blindesense cannot be Totally Blinded."

by switching, or at the end of a Scene as an Extended
Action."

a Shift Action to move and cannot apply their Speed
Evasion to attacks. This condition may be removed by
switching, or at the end of an Scene as an Extended
Action. Ghost Type Pokémon are immune to the Stuck
Condition."
Trapped,Other,"A Pokémon or Trainer that is Trapped cannot
be recalled. Ghost Type Pokémon are immune to the
Trapped Condition."
